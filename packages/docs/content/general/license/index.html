          You may use the Product to create End Products in accordance with the EULA. The End Product is a customized
          implementation of the Product requiring an application of skill and effort (f.e. a website with customized,
          modified content is an End Product because it requires skill and effort while a website which is literally
          copy-pasted isn't).

        <p class="my-2"><strong>Lifetime usage</strong></p>

          losing the right to use the Pro package itself.
        </p>

        <p class="my-2"><strong>User limits</strong></p>

        <p class="mb-2">
          Project limit for a license is specified on the checkout and during the purchase. The License grants you, the
          purchaser, an ongoing, non-exclusive right to create unlimited End Products for yourself or for multiple
          clients.

        <p class="mb-2">
          You cannot permit an end user of the End Product to use the Product separately from the End Product. (f.e.
          Your client can use the website X that you've built for him, but he cannot build another website Y himself
          using the files installed for the website X.

        <p class="mb-2">
          You cannot use the Product to create any End Products that would compete with the Product itself. (f.e. you
          cannot use it to create a framework, library, design system, CMS, template, plugin or a page generator).
