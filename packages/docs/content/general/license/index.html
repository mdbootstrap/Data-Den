              <p class="mb-2">
                You are not required to attribute or link to any specific product in any projects.
              </p>

              <p class="my-2"><strong>Right to personal use</strong></p>

              <p class="mb-2">
                The License grants you, the purchaser, an ongoing, non-exclusive, worldwide license to make use of the
                Product in personal projects, in accordance with the EULA.
              </p>

              <p class="my-2"><strong>Right to commercial use</strong></p>

              <p class="mb-2">
                The License grants you, the purchaser, an ongoing, non-exclusive, worldwide license to make use of the
                Product in commercial projects, in accordance with the EULA.
              </p>

              <p class="my-2"><strong>Right to modification</strong></p>

              <p class="mb-2">
                You may modify the resources according to your requirements.
              </p>

              <p class="my-2"><strong>Right to create the End Product</strong></p>

              <p class="mb-2">
                You may use the Product to create End Products in accordance with the EULA. The End Product is a
                customized implementation of the Product requiring an application of skill and effort (f.e. a website with
                customized, modified content is an End Product because it requires skill and
                effort while a website which is literally copy-pasted isn't).

              </p>

              <p class="my-2"><strong>Lifetime usage</strong></p>

              <p class="mb-2">
                You are entitled to use the purchased Product for life.
              </p>

              <p class="my-2"><strong>Premium Access features</strong></p>

              <p class="mb-2">
                Premium Access features are covered by a recurring subscription. As long as the subscription is active, you
                have access to all maintenance and bonus features. The user has the right to cancel the subscription
                without losing the right to use the Pro package itself.

              </p>

              <p class="my-2"><strong>User limits</strong></p>

              <p class="mb-2">
                Project limit for a license is specified on the checkout and during the purchase. The License grants you,
                the purchaser, an ongoing, non-exclusive right to create unlimited End Products for yourself or for
                multiple clients.
              </p>

              <p class="my-2 text-xl"><strong>Restrictions</strong></p>

              <p class="my-2"><strong>Unauthorized redistribution</strong></p>

              <p class="mb-2">
                You cannot redistribute, resell, lease, license, sub-license or offer the Product directly or non-directly
                to any other third party, without an explicit agreement with StartupFlow s.c..
              </p>

              <p class="my-2"><strong>Product usage by end-user</strong></p>

              <p class="mb-2">
                You cannot permit an end user of the End Product to use the Product separately from the End Product. (f.e.
                Your client can use the website X that you've built for him, but he cannot build another website Y himself
                using the files installed for the website X.
              </p>

              <p class="my-2"><strong>Open source</strong></p>

              <p class="mb-2">
                You cannot redistribute any of the software, or products created with the software to repositories like
                GitHub, where they are publicly available or include into any Open Source projects.

              </p>

              <p class="my-2"><strong>Competition</strong></p>

              <p class="mb-2">
                You cannot use the Product to create any End Products that would compete with the Product itself. (f.e.
                you cannot use it to create a framework, library, design system, CMS, template, plugin or a page
                generator).
              </p>

              <p class="my-2 text-xl"><strong>Premium Access terms:</strong></p>

              <p class="mb-2">
                            Purchase of the Pro version comes with Monthly or Annual access to maintenance features. A license holder has the right to use those features as long as their subscription is active.            </p>

              <p class="mb-2">
                              Premium Access includes:
              </p>
